            I am a student of Computer Sciences 400 level at the prestigious University of Lagos. I love the culture of Moe, so I watch alot of anime. My hobbies include Anime, Manga, Photography and any other thing that is healthy for the mind. I am not sure I have lots of skills but I can do virtually anything if I have enough explanation on what to do and execute it to the best of my ability.<br/>
                My favorite quote is <q>Keep moving foward</q>- <i>Walt Disney</i>.<br/> I also enjoy to learn new things, I do not limit my knowledge to Computer Science but I go out to learn from other fields to train my ability to think. Because of this, I would say I stand out from the crowd because I do not think the conventional way, but I use my experiences and knowledge to think up solutions.
                I am not necessarily a one-man island, I have some friends who help me out in various things. You can read about them <a href="friends.html">here</a>

Like novels, they have some key visual art to entertain the readers as they read. Here is a look at one of the key visual of a light novel I enjoy<br/>
